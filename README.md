# simple-rebound-simulation

This script simulates viral outgrowth and rebound from the HIV latent reservoir based on the stochastic model of [Hill et al.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1406663111) In addition to the basic model of Hill et al. we also consider the stochastic accumulation of mutations within a certain span of the genome.
